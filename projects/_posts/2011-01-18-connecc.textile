I wanted to change how business cards worked. They are the most dated professional tool. Business cards are used to continue a conversation, but they're not very good at it since they offer no context of the actual conversation.

I thought, you could put a unique identifier on a card that's just enough information for a computer to retain the context, but to the person receiving/giving the card, it's just a conversation being continued.

So that's what we have, conne.cc cards are the size of business cards, each has two halves perforated down the middle. Each half has a web address that you can use to continue the conversation.

The side advantage of this is it also makes it so the person receiving the card has very little work to do. They can log on and read the message posted without having to commit to anything.

I hope it works for people. I think if nothing else it has worked for myself. I love how easy it is to have a conversation, and just before it ends, reach in my pocket to give them a card. The conversation shifts online seamlessly.

It's also my first startup, and for that, it's going to be (already has) a huge learning experience. I'm excited for it to be a success or fail. Even if it fails, I will achieved and learned a lot in this. If it is a success, I will have changed a 100 year old social process. At least, in some respect.
