The Painting Gallery app was a small experiment of mine into the world of file uploads. I wanted to make a very simple site that could do image uploads with thumbnail generation, S3 storage, lightbox and drag-and-drop functionality.

Probably my simplest experiments, but one of my favorites since it only took me a few hours to get it all working!
