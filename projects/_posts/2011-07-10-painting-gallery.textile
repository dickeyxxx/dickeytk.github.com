The Painting Gallery app was a small experiment of mine into the world of file uploads. I wanted to make a very simple site that could do image uploads with thumbnail generation, S3 storage, lightbox and drag-and-drop functionality.

I used it to make myself even more familiar with using off the shelf rails gems such as:
* Compass stylesheet manager
* Sass
* Haml
* Guard
* Paperclip
* AWS-S3
* Fancybox (jQuery plugin, not a gem)

Probably my simplest experiments, but one of my favorites since it only took me a few hours to get it all working!

I especially like the San Francisco paintings I found to put on there! If you want, go ahead and add one yourself!
