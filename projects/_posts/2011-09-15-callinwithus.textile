callinwith.us is a really simple conference calling application. I was tired of how conference calls always seemed to be so complicated, and I knew with "http://twilio.com":twilio it would be really easy to make one, so I spent an evening making a really simple Rails app to wrap the API!

The result was fantastic. I just threw up a page that immediately gave the phone number and code. I figure if nobody really ends up using it, I can use it for my own personal benefit, or if it does become popular, pay for the twilio costs as long as I can until I can find a simple way to charge for it. Maybe just donations.
