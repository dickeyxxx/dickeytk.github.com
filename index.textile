My name is Jeff Dickey. I am a 25 year old web developer living in San Francisco.

I am driven by solving practical problems and impressing my clients and coworkers.

I am a versatile web developer. I have worked on large scale projects which has given me experience with difficult technical problems, in addition to smaller projects which has developed my ability to design and think like a user.

I am currently the lead engineer at Vixely building an incredibly innovative digital media platform.

My hometown is Molalla, OR. I grew up on a cattle ranch and I'm very proud of my background. I've gone from farm boy to San Francisco yuppie. Life in the big city is a lot of fun, but sometimes I miss throwing bails around on the farm.

On the side you can see some of the projects I've done in my spare time. The code for all of them is available on my Github account.
