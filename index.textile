My name is Jeff Dickey. I am a 25 year old web developer living in San Francisco.

It's a good thing writing code makes money, because the only other things I'm good at is Guitar Hero and drinking beer.

I started my professional career in the .NET realm, then quickly shifted into the Rails world. I find Rails offers me great speed in development, stability through ease of testing and allow me to remain agile with feature changes.

My hometown is Molalla, OR. I grew up on a cattle ranch and I'm very proud of my background. I've gone from farm boy to San Francisco yuppie. Life in the big city is a lot of fun, but sometimes I miss throwing bails around on the farm.

On the side you can see some of the side projects I've done. The code for all of them is available on my Github account.
