My name is Jeff Dickey. I am a 24 year old web developer living in San Francisco.

I am known for my speed. I deliver fully functional, tested products in short time.

My hometown is Molalla, OR. I grew up on a cattle ranch and I'm very proud of my background.

I started my professional career in the .NET realm, drifted into web development with ASP.NET, then discovered the open source frameworks and fell in love. I find they offer me great speed in development, stability through ease of testing and allow me to remain agile with feature changes.

On the side you can see some of the side projects I've done. The code for all of them is available on my Github account.
