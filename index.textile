My name is Jeff Dickey. I am a 25 year old web developer living in San Francisco.

I am a fast developer. I am driven by solving practical problems and impressing my clients and coworkers.

I started my professional career in the .NET realm, quickly shifted into the Rails world. I find Rails offers me great speed in development, stability through ease of testing and allow me to remain agile with feature changes.

My hometown is Molalla, OR. I grew up on a cattle ranch and I'm very proud of my background. I've gone from farm boy to San Francisco yuppie. Life in the big city is a lot of fun, but sometimes I miss throwing bails around on the farm.

On the side you can see some of the projects I've done in my spare time. The code for all of them is available on my Github account.
