My name is Jeff Dickey. I am a 24 year old web developer living in Seattle, but most of my life was in Oregon.

I am very practical. Most of my professional life has been consulting. I enjoy helping people solve their problems more than solving difficult technical problems&mdash;theoretical courses never really were my thing.

Nerdy details:

I pride myself with being able to work with many different facets of web development. I can do everything from design to APIs. I have worked with languages from .NET to Python. I value the unknown as it is where I learn the most.

My greatest ability is my speed. I am capable of delivering fully functional, tested applications in a very short time. I like to work with modern frameworks like Rails and Django because they fit my agile process.
