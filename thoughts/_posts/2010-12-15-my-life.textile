title: My life in 250 words

I was born in 1986. I am "ENTJ":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldmarshal_(Role_Variant). I grew up on a cattle ranch in rural Oregon. I discovered computers when I was young, consistently breaking them. I was addicted. That'll never change. I got into high school; I got better. I even started a side IT business. I thought I was OK at programming after a high school class, decided to major in Computer Science at Oregon State.

I spent a short 6 years in college as I discovered girls and alcohol. I also found I liked to work hard and I did a lot of extra studying. Between hosting some pretty legendary parties, I managed to have 4 jobs while I was in school.

I was giving training presentations, leading teams of developers, and loving it. The only thing I like more than coding is talking about coding. 

My senior year, I found startups were my answer: 
* I love people that really care about their jobs. 
* I love to wear tons of hats. 
* I love to take risks. 
* I hate apathy. 
* I hate bureaucracy. 

I promised myself that I would work my ass off until 30. I want to do something cool that really affects people.

Work/studying is most of my life. Still, I make time for my social life and travel whenever I get the opportunity. 

I am a gear head.

I've got a lot to learn (I wasn't mature until I hit 28), but I'm ready for whatever it takes.
