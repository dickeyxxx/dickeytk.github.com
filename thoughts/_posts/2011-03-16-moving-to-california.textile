title: Moving to California
---
This is a huge time in my life right now. The *hugest* as a matter of fact. Here's what's up:

* Tomorrow is my last day at Pokemon, my first post-graduate job, and probably one of the last places I ever thought I would work.
* The day after that (Friday) I'm loading up a u-haul and heading to Molalla for the night to see my family for the last time for a while most likely.
* Saturday I'm driving with 3 close friends, 14 hours, down to San Francisco to start my life.
* Sunday morning I'm moving into my 'California penthouse' apartment. I'm incredibly excited to see what it is going to look like. I said when I first really made the decision to move to California that 'I wanted a deck and a view of a palm tree.' I know, it's the bay, it's not Southern California, but palm trees still grow there and the ones in the Northwest are puny!

* Sunday evening to Tuesday will be a blur of drinking.
* Wednesday I start my job at Idle Games as a Senior Software Engineer.

While I was in college, I got bit by the startup bug. I wanted to make something awesome. Work with cool people that actually cared about their jobs. I was also _not_ a fan of policies and procedures of big companies and government work.

I started networking a bit, going to conferences, meeting people. The strange thing was, I was branching out. I was doing it for myself and nobody else. My whole life I had been following this path of grade school > high school > college > corporate ladder that seemed correct but wrong at the same time.

I knew corporations weren't for me. I want to work hard, I want to prove myself, I'm not interested in the paycheck or stability in the least (ok, money is cool and all, but there's more important things!). I want people to know my name.

So what happened? Well, I graduated, got a job in Seattle at Pokemon. Job was great, I was working with Python (which I had very little experience with up until that point) and on a very high traffic site. With 2 other developers, I had a huge impact on the team. After going to San Francisco though, making friends down there and seeing what the culture of companies down there was like, I knew that was where I needed to be.

I had some friends that really helped me out forwarding me job offers and I was doing VERY well getting interviews down there. I was flying down to San Francisco every other week. I flew down for a total of 5 interviews over 2 months.

I was starting to get disappointed though since I honestly didn't particularly like most of the companies. For one reason or another: culture, product, whatever. I was starting to become discouraged thinking that maybe these companies weren't what I had anticipated. I just wanted to take the first offer on the table, but I wasn't getting any since I think that disappointment showed through.

Just as things were winding down and I was starting to explore local options, my good friend Ben told me he just got a job at this company "Idle Games" and they desperately needed a Django guy (which is what I was doing at Pokemon).

I guess they had been looking for a long time to find the right Django guy, and I was a pretty good match for the position!

One thing led to another.
